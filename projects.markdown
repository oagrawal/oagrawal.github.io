**PintOS**: Strengthened support for PintOS, an OS framework for the 80x86 architecture. Optimized kernel thread scheduling with priority inheritance and aging techniques, enhancing responsiveness. Strengthened user program management with system calls and process control blocks, ensuring efficient resource allocation. Extended file system capabilities, adding support for directories, file operations, and implemented a demand-paging virtual
memory system with eviction policies for efficient memory management.
`Environment: Objective C, UNIX, ARM assembly, 80x86`

[**Full Stack Lip Reader**](https://github.com/oagrawal/Lip_Reader/tree/main): Developed a full-stack web application showcasing a deep convolutional neural network for visual speech recognition,
inspired by Oxford University’s LipNet model. Model achieved over 97.5% validation accuracy, optimized CTC loss using advanced data augmentation techniques with transfer learning and learning rate schedulers, and tweaking complexity of the model with Convolutional, stacked bidirectional LSTMs, Dropout, and Time Distributed Layers. 
`Environment: Python, TensorFlow, Streamlit, Jupyter`

**Shakespeare's Sonnet Generator**: Created an LSTM network that can generate Shakespeare's Sonnets. LSTM tokenized a corpus from opensourceshakespeare.org and trained with padded n-grams.  Achieved 80% training accuracy with raw model. 
`Environment: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Google Colaboratory`
<div style="margin-top: 30px;"></div>


**Sign Language Classifier**: Created Convolutional Neural Network that classifies images of hands into the 26 letters of the English alphabet. Images are from the Sign Language MNIST dataset. Using image augmentation, achieved a validation accuracy of 99.9%. 
`Environment: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Google Colaboratory`
<div style="margin-top: 30px;"></div>


[**Facial Recognition**](https://github.com/oagrawal/Facial_Recognition/tree/main): Created a tool that allows users control over the image database used to train a facial recognition model. By customizing the training photos, users can explore how the model responds to specific images and fine-tune its behavior. 
`Environment: Python, TKinter, OpenCV, Visual Studio Code`
